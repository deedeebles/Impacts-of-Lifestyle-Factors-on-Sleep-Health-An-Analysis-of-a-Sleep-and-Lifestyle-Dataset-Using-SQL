# Introduction 
 
The focus of this analysis is to identify key insights within a dataset that explores lifestyle factors such as sleep duration, physical activity, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, and heart rate, as well as the presence or absence of sleep disorders. Understanding these dynamics can provide valuable information for interventions and strategies aimed at improving sleep quality and overall health.
 
Insights were chosen based on their relevance to current public health concerns such as obesity, hypertension, physical inactivity, and poor sleep health. These areas are of high concern due to their link with a number of chronic diseases and decreased quality of life.
 
## Insights:
 
1. The distribution of individuals across different BMI categories. This provides an understanding of the overall health of the population under study.
 
2. The average heart rate in each BMI category. This might help identify correlations between BMI and cardiovascular health.
 
3. The average number of daily steps for each BMI category, provides insight into physical activity levels across different BMI categories.
 
4.The prevalence of each type of sleep disorder. This gives an idea of the overall sleep health of the population.
 
5. The average physical activity level for each type of sleep disorder. This could shed light on the relationship between physical activity and sleep health.
   
6.The count of individuals experiencing high-stress levels. Chronic stress is known to negatively affect health and can be linked to poor sleep.
 
7. The gender distribution and total count of individuals with a low level of physical activity. Sedentary behavior is linked to several health risks.
   
8. The number of individuals with a heart rate above 80, which could signal potential cardiovascular health issues.
 
9. The average stress level for individuals with sleep disorders, illuminating the link between stress and sleep health.
 
10. The maximum and minimum number of daily steps taken by an individual. This provides insight into the range of physical activity within the sample.
    
11. The average stress level among obese individuals. Obesity is often linked with higher stress levels.
 
12. The number of individuals with high blood pressure. Hypertension is a major risk factor for several serious health conditions.
 
13. The number of individuals with normal blood pressure who have a sleep disorder. This could reveal associations between blood pressure and sleep health.
 
14. The average physical activity level of individuals with a normal BMI, which could be used as a reference for healthy behaviour.
 
15. The average number of daily steps taken by individuals with sleep apnea. This might help to understand the impact of this disorder on physical activity.
 
16. The number of individuals with a sleep disorder and low physical activity level, highlights a possible link between sleep disorders and physical inactivity.
 
17. The number of individuals with a sleep disorder and high-stress level. This insight might reveal correlations between stress and sleep disorders.
